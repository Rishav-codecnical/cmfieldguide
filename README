This is a source code for the website and application in CM Field Guide.

The purpose of this application is to detect what platform a website is running on.  The application is developed on the Django web application framework and works by running "signatures," which are little Python scripts that test the site for various "tells."

If you know how to detect a particular CMS or web platform, we invite you to enhance or contribute a signature to improve the accuracy of the application.  Writing signatures is easy.  See the signatures package for examples.
